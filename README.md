## TMDB API Usage
TMDB API: This application uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) to fetch movie data.
### An example API Key based request looks like:
```
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?api_key=43f32466ca1ce72ff63dd88e6eeebdcd'
```
### Finding Data
Reference: [TMDB Documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/finding-data)
* `/search`: Text-based search by providing a query string and get the closest match(original, translated and alternative names and titles).[Search & Query For Details](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/search-and-query-for-details)
* `/discover`: Search based on filters or definable values like ratings, certifications or release dates. Details refer to [Here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-movie).
* `/find`: Find data with exsiting external IDs.(i.e. IMDB ID of a movie, TV show or person).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
